"""High-level git operations interface.

This module provides a clean abstraction over git subprocess calls, making the
codebase more testable and maintainable.

Architecture:
- Git: Abstract base class defining the interface
- RealGit: Production implementation using subprocess
- Standalone functions: Convenience wrappers delegating to module singleton
