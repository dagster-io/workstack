---

## Phase 1: Plan Creation

Plans can be created through two paths: interactive (via Claude) or CLI (direct).

### Interactive Path: `/erk:craft-plan`

The interactive path uses Claude's plan mode for guided plan creation:

```bash
/erk:craft-plan
```

This workflow:

1. Enters Claude plan mode with structured prompts
2. Guides plan creation with context extraction
3. Saves plan to `~/.claude/plans/*.md` (local backup)
4. Creates GitHub Issue with `erk-plan` label

### CLI Path: `erk plan create --file <path>`

Direct plan creation from a file:

```bash
erk plan create --file my-plan.md
```

This creates a GitHub Issue directly from the plan file.

### Plan Storage: Schema v2

Plans are stored in GitHub Issues using Schema v2:

- **Issue body**: Contains `plan-header` metadata block
- **First comment**: Contains `plan-body` with full plan content in collapsible details

**Issue body structure:**

````markdown
# Plan: [Title]

<!-- WARNING: Machine-generated. Manual edits may break erk tooling. -->
<!-- erk:metadata-block:plan-header -->
<details>
<summary><code>plan-header</code></summary>

```yaml
created_at: 2025-01-15T10:30:00Z
created_by: username
last_dispatched_at: null
last_dispatched_run_id: null
last_local_impl_at: null
```
````

</details>
<!-- /erk:metadata-block:plan-header -->
```

**First comment structure:**

```markdown
<!-- erk:metadata-block:plan-body -->
<details>
<summary><code>plan-body</code></summary>

[Full plan content here]

</details>
<!-- /erk:metadata-block:plan-body -->
```

### The `erk-plan` Label

The `erk-plan` label marks issues as implementation plans:

- **Auto-created** if it doesn't exist (green, #0E8A16)
- **Required** for submission and implementation
- **Validated** before workflow dispatch

---

## Phase 2: Plan Submission

Submission prepares the plan for remote execution via `erk submit <issue_number>`.

**Key responsibility**: `erk submit` is the **source of truth** for branch and PR creation. The workflow dispatch (Phase 3) expects these to already exist.

### Pre-Submission Validation

Before submission, the command validates:

1. **Label check**: Issue must have `erk-plan` label
2. **State check**: Issue must be OPEN (not closed)
3. **Clean working directory**: No uncommitted changes

### Branch Creation

Branch names are derived deterministically from the issue title:

```python
derive_branch_name_with_date(issue_title)
```

**Format**: `{slugified-title-30chars}-YY-MM-DD-HHMM`

**Example**: "Add user authentication" → `add-user-authentication-25-11-29-1442`

### `.worker-impl/` Folder Creation

The submit command creates the `.worker-impl/` folder structure:

```
.worker-impl/
├── plan.md         # Full plan content from issue
├── progress.md     # Initial progress tracking (all unchecked)
├── issue.json      # GitHub issue reference
└── README.md       # Documentation for the folder
```

**`issue.json` structure:**

```json
{
  "issue_number": 123,
  "issue_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "synced_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Draft PR Creation

A draft PR is created locally (for correct commit attribution):

- **Title**: Issue title with "Plan: " prefix stripped
- **Body**: Includes "Closes #N" for automatic issue closing
- **State**: Draft (marked ready after implementation)

### `distinct_id` Generation

A 6-character base36 identifier is generated for workflow run discovery:

- Used in workflow `run-name` for matching
- Enables polling to find the specific run
- Format: `{issue_number}:{distinct_id}` in run display title

### Metadata Update

After submission, the issue receives a `submission-queued` comment with metadata:

```yaml
schema: submission-queued
queued_at: 2025-01-15T10:30:00Z
submitted_by: username
issue_number: 123
validation_results:
  issue_is_open: true
  has_erk_plan_label: true
expected_workflow: dispatch-erk-queue-git
```

---

## Phase 3: Workflow Dispatch

The `dispatch-erk-queue-git.yml` workflow handles remote implementation.

### Workflow Inputs

| Input          | Description                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `issue_number` | GitHub issue number to implement     |
| `submitted_by` | GitHub username of submitter         |
| `distinct_id`  | 6-char base36 for run discovery      |
| `issue_title`  | Issue title for workflow run display |

### Concurrency Control

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: implement-issue-${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

This ensures only one implementation runs per issue at a time.

### Workflow Phases

#### Phase 1: Checkout & Setup

- Checkout repository with full history
- Install tools: `uv`, `erk`, `dot-agent-kit`, `claude`, `prettier`
- Configure git with submitter identity
- Detect trunk branch (main or master)

#### Phase 2: Find PR & Checkout Branch

- Find existing PR via "Closes #N" search pattern (created by `erk submit`)
- Checkout the implementation branch
- Update `.worker-impl/` with fresh plan content (for reruns)

#### Phase 3: Use Existing PR

- Use existing PR (created by `erk submit`)
- Post `workflow-started` comment to issue
- Update issue body with `last_dispatched_run_id`

#### Phase 4: Implementation

- Copy `.worker-impl/` to `.impl/` (Claude reads `.impl/`)
- Create `.impl/run-info.json` with workflow run details
- Execute `/erk:plan-implement` with Claude

#### Phase 5: Submission

- Stage implementation changes (NOT `.worker-impl/` deletion)
- Run `/git:pr-push` to create proper commit message
- Clean up `.worker-impl/` in separate commit
- Mark PR ready for review
- Update PR body with implementation summary
- Trigger CI via empty commit

---

## Phase 4: Implementation

Implementation executes the plan, whether locally or via GitHub Actions.

### `.worker-impl/` vs `.impl/`

| Folder          | Purpose                                      | Git Status                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `.worker-impl/` | Remote implementation (GitHub Actions)       | Committed, then deleted          |
| `.impl/`        | Local implementation + Claude's working copy | In `.gitignore`, never committed |

In GitHub Actions, `.worker-impl/` is copied to `.impl/` before Claude runs.

### `.impl/run-info.json`

Created in GitHub Actions to track the workflow run:

```json
{
  "run_id": "1234567890",
  "run_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/1234567890"
}
```

### `/erk:plan-implement` Command

The implementation command:

1. Validates `.impl/` exists with `plan.md` and `progress.md`
2. Creates TodoWrite entries for tracking
3. Posts start comment to GitHub issue (if linked)
4. Executes each phase sequentially
5. Updates `progress.md` as steps complete
6. Runs CI validation
7. Cleans up artifacts

### Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked in `.impl/progress.md`:

```markdown
---
completed_steps: 3
total_steps: 5
steps:
  - text: "1. First step"
    completed: true
  - text: "2. Second step"
    completed: true
  - text: "3. Third step"
    completed: true
  - text: "4. Fourth step"
    completed: false
  - text: "5. Fifth step"
    completed: false
---

# Progress Tracking

- [x] 1. First step
- [x] 2. Second step
- [x] 3. Third step
- [ ] 4. Fourth step
- [ ] 5. Fifth step
```

Use kit CLI commands to update progress:

```bash
dot-agent run erk mark-step 1        # Mark step 1 complete
dot-agent run erk mark-step 1 2 3    # Mark multiple steps
dot-agent run erk get-progress       # Show current progress
```

---

## Phase 5: PR Finalization & Merge

The final phase prepares the PR for review and merge.

### `/git:pr-push` Submission

The pure git submission flow:

1. Analyze staged changes
2. Generate AI commit message
3. Commit with proper attribution
4. Push to remote
5. Update PR body with summary

### `.worker-impl/` Cleanup

In GitHub Actions, `.worker-impl/` is removed in a separate commit:

```bash
git rm -rf .worker-impl/
git commit -m "Remove .worker-impl/ folder after implementation"
git push
```

This keeps the implementation commit clean.

### PR Ready for Review

```bash
gh pr ready "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

Marks the draft PR as ready for review.

### PR Body Update

The PR body is updated with:

1. Implementation summary (from commit message)
2. Standardized footer from `get-pr-metadata`
3. Checkout instructions

### CI Trigger

An empty commit triggers push-event workflows:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger CI workflows"
git push
```

This is needed because workflow dispatch doesn't trigger PR workflows.

### Auto-Close on Merge

The PR body contains "Closes #N" which automatically closes the issue when merged:

```markdown
Closes #123
```

Generated by `get_closing_text()` from `.impl/issue.json`.

---

## State Linking Mechanisms

Entities are connected through deterministic naming and metadata.

### Branch → Issue

Branch names are derived deterministically:

```python
derive_branch_name_with_date(issue_title)
```

**Format**: `{slugified-title-30chars}-YY-MM-DD-HHMM`

This allows reconstructing the branch name from any issue.

### PR → Issue

The PR body contains "Closes #{issue_number}":

- Generated from `.impl/issue.json`
- GitHub automatically closes issue on merge
- Created by `get_closing_text()` function

### Issue → Workflow Run

The `plan-header` metadata block contains:

```yaml
last_dispatched_run_id: "1234567890"
last_dispatched_at: 2025-01-15T10:30:00Z
```

Updated by `update-dispatch-info` kit CLI command.

### Workflow Run → Issue

The workflow receives `issue_number` as input:

```yaml
inputs:
  issue_number:
    description: "GitHub issue number to implement"
    required: true
```

Available throughout as `${{ inputs.issue_number }}`.

### Run Discovery

The `distinct_id` enables finding the specific workflow run:

1. **Generation**: 6-char base36 created at dispatch time
2. **Run name**: Set to `"{issue_number}:{distinct_id}"`
3. **Polling**: Match runs by `displayTitle` containing `:distinct_id`

---

## Metadata Block Reference

All metadata blocks use a consistent format:

````html
<!-- erk:metadata-block:{key} -->
<details>
  <summary><code>{key}</code></summary>

  ```yaml {structured_data}
</details>
````

</details>
<!-- /erk:metadata-block:{key} -->
```
