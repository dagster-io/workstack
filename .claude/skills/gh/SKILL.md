# GitHub CLI (gh)

## Overview

GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the official command-line tool for GitHub that brings pull requests, issues, releases, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal. This skill provides comprehensive guidance for using `gh` to streamline GitHub workflows, including PR management, issue tracking, repository operations, and API access.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when users:

- Mention GitHub CLI (`gh`) commands or workflows
- Ask about creating, viewing, or managing pull requests from the command line
- Need help with GitHub issue management via CLI
- Want to understand gh's mental model or command structure
- Request guidance on GitHub automation or scripting
- Ask about GitHub API access through gh
- Need help with gh authentication or configuration
- Request integration patterns between gh, git, and other tools (like workstack)

## Core Concepts

Before providing guidance, understand these key concepts:

**Three-Layer Architecture:**

1. **High-Level Commands** (porcelain): `gh pr`, `gh issue`, `gh repo` - user-friendly workflows
2. **API Access**: `gh api` - direct REST/GraphQL access with built-in auth
3. **Git Integration**: Smart repo detection from git remotes and current branch

**Context Resolution:**

- `gh` automatically detects repository from git remotes
- Uses current branch to infer PR context
- Falls back to interactive selection when ambiguous

**Mental Model:**
Think of `gh` as "GitHub workflows made CLI-native" - each command maps to a common GitHub workflow optimized for terminal use.

## Using the Reference Documentation

When providing gh guidance, load the comprehensive reference documentation:

```
references/gh.md
```

This reference contains:

- Complete mental model and terminology
- Full command reference for PRs, issues, repos, releases, and more
- Authentication and configuration patterns
- Workflow patterns for common scenarios
- Integration details (workstack, git, CI/CD)
- GitHub API access patterns
- Practical examples for daily development

**Loading Strategy:**

- Always load `references/gh.md` when user asks gh-related questions
- The reference is comprehensive (~1480 lines) but optimized for progressive reading
- Use grep patterns to find specific sections when needed:
  - `gh pr` - Pull request commands
  - `gh issue` - Issue management commands
  - `gh repo` - Repository operations
  - `gh api` - API access patterns
  - `Pattern [0-9]:` - Workflow patterns
  - `Authentication` - Auth setup
  - `workstack Integration` - Integration with workstack

## Common Operations

When users ask for help with gh, guide them using these patterns:

### First-Time Setup

1. Check if gh is installed: `gh --version`
2. Authenticate: `gh auth login` (interactive) or `gh auth status` (check current)
3. Configure defaults: `gh config set <key> <value>`
4. Test connection: `gh repo view` (in a git repo)

### Pull Request Operations

Load `references/gh.md` and search for "gh pr" section to provide:

- Creating PRs: `gh pr create` (interactive or with flags)
- Viewing PRs: `gh pr view`, `gh pr list`
- Checking out PRs: `gh pr checkout <number>`
- Reviewing PRs: `gh pr review`, `gh pr diff`
- Merging PRs: `gh pr merge`
- PR status checks: `gh pr checks`

### Issue Management

Load `references/gh.md` and search for "gh issue" section to provide:

- Creating issues: `gh issue create`
- Listing issues: `gh issue list` (with filters)

## Workflow Guidance

When users describe their workflow needs, map them to patterns in the reference:

**Pattern 1: Daily PR Workflow** - Create, review, merge PRs
**Pattern 2: Issue Triage** - List, filter, and manage issues
**Pattern 3: Release Automation** - Script release creation and asset management
**Pattern 4: PR Checks and Status** - Monitor CI/CD and review status
**Pattern 5: Multi-Repo Operations** - Work across multiple repositories
**Pattern 6: GitHub API Scripting** - Automate complex GitHub workflows
**Pattern 7: Code Review Workflow** - Review PRs from command line

Load the appropriate pattern sections from `references/gh.md` based on user needs.

5. **GitHub Actions**: Interact with workflows via `gh workflow`

Load the relevant sections from `references/gh.md` for each advanced feature.

### GraphQL API Reference

When standard `gh` commands are insufficient, use GraphQL via `gh api graphql`. Load `references/graphql.md` for comprehensive GraphQL guidance.

**When to Use GraphQL:**

Use GraphQL when the porcelain commands (`gh pr`, `gh issue`, etc.) cannot accomplish the task:

- **Projects V2**: No REST API exists - all operations require GraphQL
  - Create/update projects
  - Add items and update field values
  - Query custom fields and project data

- **Discussions**: No porcelain commands available
  - Create/manage discussions
  - Add comments and replies
  - Query discussion categories

- **Batch Operations**: Query multiple resources in one API call
  - Compare multiple repositories
  - Aggregate data across repos
  - Reduce rate limit consumption

- **Complex Queries**: Fetch nested data efficiently
  - PR with reviews, comments, and status checks in one call
  - Issue with timeline, reactions, and linked PRs
  - Repository with open issues, PRs, and contributors

- **Advanced Search**: Complex filtering beyond basic commands
  - Multi-criteria issue/PR searches
  - Boolean logic and date ranges
  - Advanced sorting options

- **Custom Fields**: Precise field selection
  - Request only needed fields
  - Optimize for performance
  - Build custom data aggregations

**GraphQL Resources:**

- `references/graphql.md` - Complete GraphQL guide including:
  - Use cases requiring GraphQL
  - Common patterns (variables, pagination, batching, etc.)
  - Complete examples (Projects V2, Discussions, batch queries)
  - Best practices and troubleshooting

- `references/graphql-schema-core.md` - Core schema types (load only when needed):
  - Detailed field information for Repository, Issue, PullRequest, etc.
  - Projects V2 field types and mutations
  - Discussion types and operations
  - Input types and enums

**Loading Strategy:**

1. Start with `references/graphql.md` for use cases and patterns
2. Load `references/graphql-schema-core.md` only when detailed schema info is needed
3. Use grep patterns to find specific sections:
   - `Projects V2` - Project automation examples
   - `Discussion` - Discussion API examples
   - `Batch` - Batch query patterns
   - `Pagination` - Cursor-based pagination
   - `Example [0-9]` - Complete working examples

## Troubleshooting

When users encounter issues:

1. Check authentication: `gh auth status`
2. Verify repository detection: `gh repo view`
3. Test API access: `gh api user`
4. Review configuration: `gh config list`
5. Check rate limits: `gh api rate_limit`
6. Enable debug mode: `GH_DEBUG=api gh <command>`

Load the Troubleshooting section from `references/gh.md` for specific error patterns.

## Command Discovery

When users ask "what can gh do?":

- Start with overview of main commands: `pr`, `issue`, `repo`, `release`, `workflow`
- Show command help: `gh <command> --help`
- Demonstrate interactive mode: most commands work interactively
- Point to `gh api` for anything not covered by porcelain commands
- Reference the full command reference in `references/gh.md`
