<!-- AGENT NOTICE: This file is loaded automatically. Read FULLY before writing code. -->
<!-- Priority: This is a ROUTING FILE. Load skills and docs as directed for complete guidance. -->

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Before Writing Any Code

**CRITICAL: NEVER search, read, or access `/Users/schrockn/` directory**

**CRITICAL: NEVER use raw `pip install`. Always use `uv` for package management.**

**CRITICAL: NEVER commit directly to `master`. Always create a feature branch first.**

**Load these skills FIRST:**

- **Python code** → `dignified-python-313` skill (LBYL, modern types, ABC interfaces)
- **Test code** → `fake-driven-testing` skill (5-layer architecture, test placement)
- **Dev tools** → Use `devrun` agent (NOT direct Bash for pytest/pyright/ruff/prettier/make/gt)

## Skill Loading Behavior

**Skills persist for the entire session.** Once loaded, they remain in context.

- **DO NOT reload skills already loaded in this session**
- Hook reminders fire as safety nets, not commands
- If you see a reminder for an already-loaded skill, acknowledge and continue

**Check if loaded**: Look for `<command-message>The "{name}" skill is loading</command-message>` earlier in conversation

## Graphite Stack Quick Reference

- **UPSTACK** = away from trunk (toward leaves/top)
- **DOWNSTACK** = toward trunk (main at BOTTOM)
- **Full details**: Load `gt-graphite` skill for complete visualization and mental model

## Erk-Specific Architecture

Core patterns for this codebase:

- **Dry-run via dependency injection** (not boolean flags)
- **Context regeneration** (after os.chdir or worktree removal)
- **Two-layer subprocess wrappers** (integration vs CLI boundaries)

**Full guide**: [docs/agent/erk-architecture.md](docs/agent/erk-architecture.md)

## Project Naming Conventions

- **Functions/variables**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **CLI commands**: `kebab-case`
- **Claude artifacts**: `kebab-case` (commands, skills, agents, hooks in `.claude/`)
- **Brand names**: `GitHub` (not Github)

**Claude Artifacts:** All files in `.claude/` (commands, skills, agents, hooks) MUST use `kebab-case`. Use hyphens, NOT underscores. Example: `/my-command` not `/my_command`. Python scripts within artifacts may use `snake_case` (they're code, not artifacts).

**Worktree Terminology:** Use "root worktree" (not "main worktree") to refer to the primary git worktree created with `git init`. This ensures "main" unambiguously refers to the branch name, since trunk branches can be named either "main" or "master". In code, use the `is_root` field to identify the root worktree.

**CLI Command Organization:** Plan verbs are top-level (create, get, implement), worktree verbs are grouped under `erk wt`, stack verbs under `erk stack`. This follows the "plan is dominant noun" principle for ergonomic access to high-frequency operations. See [docs/agent/cli-command-organization.md](docs/agent/cli-command-organization.md) for complete decision framework.

## Project Constraints

**No time estimates in plans:**

- 🔴 **FORBIDDEN**: Time estimates (hours, days, weeks)
- 🔴 **FORBIDDEN**: Velocity predictions or completion dates
- 🔴 **FORBIDDEN**: Effort quantification

**Test discipline:**

- 🔴 **FORBIDDEN**: Writing tests for speculative or "maybe later" features
- ✅ **ALLOWED**: TDD workflow (write test → implement feature → refactor)
- 🔴 **MUST**: Only test actively implemented code
