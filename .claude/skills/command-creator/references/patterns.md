# Command Patterns

This document describes the common patterns for slash commands, helping you choose the right structure for your workflow.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Workflow Automation Pattern

**Structure:** Analyze → Act → Report

**When to use:**

- Multi-step workflows with clear sequence
- Commands that need to analyze before acting
- Workflows that produce specific outputs (commits, PRs, reports)

**Example workflow:**

1. Check for context files (e.g., `.PLAN.md`)
2. Analyze current state (git status, file changes)
3. Perform actions (create commit, submit PR)
4. Report results to user

**Key features:**

- Explicit file check order
- Conditional logic based on file existence
- Clear success output format
- Context-aware decision making

**Pattern example:**

```markdown
1. Check for .PLAN.md in repository root
   - If exists: use plan context for commit message
   - If not: analyze git changes and draft message

2. Review git status and diff
   - Identify staged and unstaged changes
   - Determine scope of changes

3. Create commit with descriptive message
   - Follow repository's commit message style
   - Include co-author attribution

4. Submit PRs with Graphite
   - Use gt stack submit
   - Report PR URLs to user
```

### 2. Iterative Fixing Pattern

**Structure:** Run → Parse → Fix → Repeat

**When to use:**

- Commands that fix issues iteratively (linting, tests, CI)
- Workflows that need multiple attempts to succeed
- Tasks with clear pass/fail criteria

**Example workflow:**

1. Run check command (e.g., `make all-ci`)
2. Parse failures by type
3. Apply targeted fixes
4. Run check again to verify
5. Repeat until success or max iterations reached

**Key features:**

- Iteration control (max attempts, stuck detection)
- Progress tracking with TodoWrite
- Clear stopping conditions
- Categorization of failure types
- Incremental fix application

**Pattern example:**

```markdown
1. Run make all-ci (max 10 iterations)

2. If check fails:
   - Parse error output by category (pyright, ruff, tests)
   - Create todos for each error category
   - Apply fixes for each category sequentially
   - Mark todo complete after fixing each category

3. After each fix iteration:
   - Run make all-ci again
   - Check if new errors appeared
   - If stuck (same errors 2+ times): stop and report

4. Stop when:
   - All checks pass (exit code 0)
   - Max iterations reached
   - Detected stuck state
```

### 3. Agent Delegation Pattern

**Structure:** Context → Delegate → Iterate

**When to use:**

- Complex tasks requiring specialized agents
- Multi-phase workflows with human review
- Tasks that benefit from agent specialization

**Example workflow:**

1. Present planning context to user
2. Invoke specialized agent (via Task tool)
3. Agent creates plan/output iteratively
4. Plan is reviewed and refined by user
5. Save results to disk after approval

**Key features:**

- Clear agent invocation instructions
- Phase-based workflow (planning → review → execution)
- Explicit save-to-disk trigger
- User review checkpoints
- Context gathering before delegation

**Pattern example:**

```markdown
1. Present planning context
   - Explain what the agent will do
   - Set expectations for iterative process
   - Mention that user can refine the output

2. Invoke implementation-planner agent
   - Use Task tool with subagent_type="implementation-planner"
   - Pass task description and context
   - Do NOT attempt to write plan yourself

3. Agent works autonomously
   - Creates initial plan
   - Iterates with user feedback
   - Refines based on questions/concerns

4. After user approves plan
   - Save to .PLAN.md
   - Confirm location with user
   - Explain next steps (execution)
```

### 4. Simple Execution Pattern

**Structure:** Parse Arguments → Execute → Return Output

**When to use:**

- Single-step commands with arguments
- Wrapper commands for existing tools
- Commands that simply run and report

**Example workflow:**

1. Parse command arguments
2. Run specific command or script with arguments
3. Handle and display output
4. Report success or failure

**Key features:**

- Argument handling (required vs optional)
- Direct tool invocation
- Minimal logic
- Output formatting

**Pattern example:**

```markdown
1. Parse [base-branch] argument
   - If provided: use specified branch
   - If not provided: use main/master

2. Run codex-review script
   - Pass base-branch to script
   - Capture output

3. Display results
   - Show review findings
   - Report issues found
   - Suggest fixes if applicable
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

**When to use:** Complex workflows requiring multiple specialized agents in sequence

**Pattern:**

```markdown
1. Use Task tool with subagent_type="Explore" to find relevant files
   - Search for specific patterns
   - Identify key components

2. Use Task tool with subagent_type="implementation-planner" to create plan
   - Pass context from exploration
   - Generate detailed implementation plan
   - Review with user

3. Use Task tool with subagent_type="haiku-plan-executor" to execute
   - Load plan from .PLAN.md
   - Execute steps systematically
   - Report completion
```

### Context File Priority Checks

**When to use:** Commands that can operate in different modes based on available context

**Pattern:**

```markdown
Check these files in order for context:

1. .PLAN.md - implementation plan (highest priority)
2. .github/CONTRIBUTING.md - contribution guidelines
3. CLAUDE.md - coding standards
4. README.md - project overview

Use the first file found to inform the workflow. Different files trigger different behaviors.
```

### Conditional Tool Selection

**When to use:** Commands that choose tools/approach based on task complexity

**Pattern:**

```markdown
Analyze scope of changes:

If changes span 3+ files OR involve new abstractions:

- Use implementation-planner agent
- Create detailed plan
- Execute with plan-executor

Otherwise:

- Execute changes directly
- Use simpler workflow
- Skip planning overhead
```

### Makefile Integration Pattern

**When to use:** Commands that need to run make targets

**Pattern:**

```markdown
**IMPORTANT:** Always use makefile-runner agent for make commands

1. Use Task tool with subagent_type="makefile-runner"
   - Pass the make target: "make all-ci"
   - Do NOT use Bash tool for make commands
   - Agent will handle execution and output

2. Process results from agent
   - Check exit code
   - Parse any errors
   - Apply fixes if needed
```

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

**When to use:** Commands that start simple but can get more complex based on results

**Pattern:**

```markdown
1. Start with minimal check
   - Run basic validation
   - Identify if deeper work needed

2. If issues found:
   - Expand scope progressively
   - Add todos for each issue category
   - Handle incrementally

3. Only go deeper if necessary
   - Don't over-analyze upfront
   - Let results guide next steps
   - Stop when criteria met
```

## Combining Patterns

Commands often combine multiple patterns. For example:

**submit-stack combines:**

- Context File Priority (check .PLAN.md)
- Workflow Automation (analyze → commit → submit)
- Conditional Tool Selection (use plan if exists)

**ensure-ci combines:**

- Iterative Fixing (run → fix → repeat)
- Makefile Integration (use makefile-runner)
- Progressive Disclosure (expand todos as issues found)
