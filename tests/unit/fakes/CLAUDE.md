# Testing Fake Implementations

## Directory Structure

**Important:** This directory is nested under `tests/unit/` which has its own `__init__.py`. This structure prevents Python from treating the directory as a namespace package, which would break absolute imports.

When adding new test directories under `tests/`, always ensure:

1. The parent directory has `__init__.py` (e.g., `tests/unit/__init__.py`)
2. The new directory itself has `__init__.py` (e.g., `tests/unit/fakes/__init__.py`)

This ensures `from tests.fakes.gitops import FakeGitOps` works correctly from any test file.

## Purpose

These tests verify that fake implementations correctly simulate real behavior.
This directory tests the **test infrastructure itself**, not production code.

## What Goes Here

Tests OF the fakes themselves:

- `test_fake_gitops.py` - Verifies FakeGitOps mutation tracking, state management
- `test_fake_global_config_ops.py` - Verifies FakeGlobalConfigOps config storage
- `test_fake_graphite_ops.py` - Verifies FakeGraphiteOps stack tracking
- `test_fake_github_ops.py` - Verifies FakeGitHubOps PR simulation
- `test_fake_shell_ops.py` - Verifies FakeShellOps command tracking

## What DOESN'T Go Here

❌ Tests that USE fakes to test production code
→ Go in `tests/commands/` or `tests/core/`

❌ Tests of real implementations with subprocess/filesystem
→ Go in `tests/integration/`

## Testing Pattern

```python
def test_fake_tracks_mutation() -> None:
    """Test that FakeGitOps tracks worktree additions."""
    git_ops = FakeGitOps()

    # Perform operation on fake
    git_ops.add_worktree(Path("/repo"), Path("/worktree"), branch="feature")

    # Verify fake tracked the mutation
    assert (Path("/worktree"), "feature") in git_ops.added_worktrees
    assert len(git_ops.list_worktrees(Path("/repo"))) == 1
```

## Key Principle

These tests ensure fakes are **reliable test doubles** for production code tests.
If fakes don't work correctly, all tests ABOVE the fakes layer are unreliable.
