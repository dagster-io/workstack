# Stacked Rebase - Master Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides the master plan for implementing **Stacked Rebase**, a safe rebasing system that builds rebases in isolated "rebase stacks" (temporary worktrees) before applying them to actual branches.

## Feature Summary

**Stacked Rebase** transforms git rebasing from a high-stakes operation into a safe, predictable workflow:

- Preview rebases before applying
- Resolve conflicts in isolation
- Test changes before committing to them
- Apply only when confident

## Terminology

- **Stacked Rebase**: The feature that stages rebases safely before applying
- **Rebase Stack**: The temporary work area (worktree) where rebases are prepared and tested
- Users interact with "rebase stacks", not "sandboxes" or "temporary worktrees"

## Implementation Strategy

The feature is broken into **6 sequential PRs**, each delivering working functionality:

| PR  | Name                   | Dependencies | Deliverable                       |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 1   | Core Git Operations    | None         | Git rebase primitives             |
| 2   | Rebase Stack Manager   | PR 1         | Stack lifecycle management        |
| 3   | Basic CLI with Preview | PR 1-2       | Preview rebases safely            |
| 4   | Conflict Resolution    | PR 1-3       | Full rebase + resolution workflow |
| 5   | Testing & Validation   | PR 1-4       | Test before applying              |
| 6   | Polish & Integration   | PR 1-5       | Production-ready feature          |

## Detailed PR Plans

Each PR has a dedicated detailed plan document:

### [PR 1: Core Git Operations Extensions](STACKED_REBASE_PR1_GIT_OPERATIONS.md)

- `workstack rebase preview` command
- Create and preview rebase stacks
- Show conflicts without resolution
- Stack cleanup on abort

**Key Deliverables**:

- `cli/commands/rebase.py` module
- Preview command working end-to-end
- User documentation

### [PR 4: Conflict Resolution System](STACKED_REBASE_PR4_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md)

**Timeline**: Week 4-5
**Focus**: Complete rebase workflow

Adds interactive conflict resolution and apply functionality:

- `workstack rebase resolve` command
- Interactive conflict resolution
- `workstack rebase apply` command
- Full rebase workflow completion

**Key Deliverables**:

- `conflict_resolver.py` module
- Resolve and apply commands
- E2E conflict scenarios

### [PR 5: Testing & Validation](STACKED_REBASE_PR5_TESTING.md)

**Timeline**: Week 5-6
**Focus**: Test before apply

Adds ability to run tests in rebase stacks:

- `workstack rebase test` command
- Auto-detect test commands
- Pre-apply validation checks
- Test result reporting

**Key Deliverables**:

- `stack_test_runner.py` module
- Test command integration
- Validation framework

### [PR 6: Polish & Integration](STACKED_REBASE_PR6_POLISH.md)

**Timeline**: Week 6-7
**Focus**: Production readiness

Adds configuration, persistence, and UX improvements:

- Configuration options
- State persistence across sessions
- Rich progress indicators
- Integration with existing commands
- Interactive guided mode

**Key Deliverables**:

- Configuration system
- State persistence
- UX enhancements
- Full integration

## Implementation Principles

### 1. Sequential Development

Each PR builds on the previous one. PRs cannot be developed in parallel.

### 2. Independent Mergeability

Each PR must be independently reviewable and mergeable:

- Pass all tests
- Include documentation
- Provide user value (except infrastructure PRs)
- Maintain backwards compatibility

### 3. Test Coverage

Every PR must include:

- Unit tests for new code
- Integration tests for interactions
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Target: 90%+ coverage for new code

### 4. Documentation

Each PR includes:

- Code documentation (docstrings)
- User-facing documentation
- Migration notes if applicable

## Success Criteria

### Overall Feature Success

- Zero data loss during rebase operations
- Clear preview of changes before applying
- Intuitive conflict resolution
- Seamless integration with workstack
- Performance: <5s preview, <10s apply

### Per-PR Success

- All tests pass
- Documentation complete
- Code review approved
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Timeline

**Total Duration**: 6-7 weeks

- **Weeks 1-2**: PR 1 (Git Operations) - Foundation
- **Week 2-3**: PR 2 (Stack Manager) - Infrastructure
- **Week 3-4**: PR 3 (Basic CLI) - First user feature
- **Week 4-5**: PR 4 (Conflict Resolution) - Core workflow
- **Week 5-6**: PR 5 (Testing) - Quality assurance
- **Week 6-7**: PR 6 (Polish) - Production ready

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Git worktree edge cases
**Mitigation**: Extensive testing, error recovery, clear error messages

**Risk**: Complex conflict scenarios
**Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, start with simple cases

**Risk**: Performance issues
**Mitigation**: Benchmark each PR, optimize before next PR

### Process Risks

**Risk**: PR dependencies block progress
**Mitigation**: Clear PR scope, avoid scope creep

**Risk**: Late-stage design changes
**Mitigation**: Validate design in early PRs

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Features to consider after initial implementation:

- Graphite stack integration for multi-branch rebases
- Conflict resolution patterns/templates
- Rebase stack sharing between developers
- Advanced interactive modes
- Performance optimizations
- AI-assisted conflict resolution
