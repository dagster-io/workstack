## 1. Stack Lifecycle Management

### Overview
Complete lifecycle management for Graphite stacks, from creation to merge, with intelligent worktree coordination.

### Detailed Implementation

**Stack Creation Wizard:**
```bash
$ workstack stack create
Stack Creation Wizard

What are you building?
> Feature with multiple phases
  Bugfix with prerequisite changes
  Refactor in stages
  Experimental changes

Enter base feature name: user-auth

How many phases? 3

Phase 1 name: auth-backend
Phase 2 name: auth-frontend
Phase 3 name: auth-tests

Creating stack:
  main
    └─ user-auth-backend
         └─ user-auth-frontend
              └─ user-auth-tests

Options:
  [x] Create worktrees for all branches
  [x] Set up PR drafts
  [ ] Share stack plan with team

Creating:
  ✓ Branch user-auth-backend (via gt create)
  ✓ Worktree auth-backend
  ✓ Branch user-auth-frontend (via gt create)
  ✓ Worktree auth-frontend
  ✓ Branch user-auth-tests (via gt create)
  ✓ Worktree auth-tests

Stack created! Current structure:
  main
    └─ user-auth-backend [@auth-backend]
         └─ user-auth-frontend [@auth-frontend]
              └─ user-auth-tests [@auth-tests]

Next: workstack switch auth-backend
```

**Stack Adoption (Existing Branches):**
```bash
$ workstack stack adopt feature/login

Found existing Graphite stack:
  main
    └─ feature/base
         └─ feature/login ← (current)
              └─ feature/login-ui
                   └─ feature/login-tests

Create worktrees for entire stack?
  [x] feature/base → base
  [x] feature/login → login (current)
  [x] feature/login-ui → login-ui
  [x] feature/login-tests → login-tests

✓ Created 3 worktrees for stack members
✓ Stack fully managed by workstack
```

**Stack Destruction:**
```bash
$ workstack stack destroy auth

This will remove the entire stack:
  - auth-backend [PR #234 - merged]
  - auth-frontend [PR #235 - open]
  - auth-tests [PR #236 - draft]

Options:
  [x] Remove worktrees
  [x] Delete local branches
  [ ] Delete remote branches (requires PR merge/close)
  [x] Archive PR discussions

Proceed? [y/N] y

✓ Archived PR discussions to ~/.workstack/archives/auth-stack/
✓ Removed 3 worktrees
✓ Deleted local branches
✓ Stack destroyed
```

### Benefits
- Simplified creation of complex stacks
- Consistent naming and structure
- Complete cleanup when done
- Reduced manual coordination

## 3. Stack-Aware Conflict Resolution

### Overview
Intelligent conflict resolution that understands stack dependencies and guides through resolution across multiple worktrees.

### Detailed Implementation

**Conflict Detection:**
```bash
$ workstack stack rebase

Analyzing stack for conflicts...

Conflicts detected in cascade:
  1. auth-backend: Clean rebase possible ✓
  2. auth-frontend: 2 conflicts after rebasing on auth-backend
  3. auth-tests: 5 conflicts after rebasing on auth-frontend

Strategy:
  → Fix conflicts in order (top to bottom)
  → Each resolution cascades to children

Start resolution? [Y/n]
```

**Guided Resolution Workflow:**
```bash
$ workstack stack resolve

Starting conflict resolution for: auth-frontend

Conflict 1 of 2: src/auth.js
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Parent (auth-backend) introduced:
  + function validateUser() { ... }

Your changes conflict:
  - function checkUser() { ... }
  + function validateUser() { ... } // different implementation

Options:
  1. Keep parent version
  2. Keep your version
  3. Manual merge
  4. View full diff
  5. Open in merge tool

Select: 3

Opening in editor with conflict markers...
✓ Conflict resolved

Propagating resolution to child branches...
  ✓ auth-tests: Automatically resolved (same resolution applies)

Continue to next conflict? [Y/n]
```

**Conflict Prevention:**
```bash
$ workstack stack lint

Analyzing stack for potential conflicts...

⚠ Warning: High conflict risk detected

auth-frontend modifies:
  - src/auth.js (lines 45-89)

auth-backend also modifies:
  - src/auth.js (lines 50-75)

Suggestion:
  Consider splitting src/auth.js into separate files:
  - src/auth/validation.js (backend changes)
  - src/auth/frontend.js (frontend changes)

Auto-split files? [y/N]
```

### Benefits
- Systematic conflict resolution
- Prevents cascade conflicts
- Suggests preventive refactoring
- Reduces merge complexity

   > workstack create calc-core

   ✓ Good! You created the first layer.

2. Add basic operations (+, -, *, /)
   [Interactive code editing session]

   ✓ Nice work! You've made focused changes.

3. Create dependent branch 'calc-advanced'
   > workstack create calc-advanced

   ✓ Excellent! You're building on calc-core.

Your stack:
  main
    └─ calc-core ✓
         └─ calc-advanced ← You are here

Continue to next exercise? [Y/n]
```

**Best Practices Enforcement:**

## 9. Cross-Stack Dependencies

### Overview
Manage complex scenarios where changes span multiple stacks with intelligent dependency tracking.

### Detailed Implementation

**Dependency Detection:**
```bash
$ workstack stack deps

Analyzing cross-stack dependencies...

Your stacks:
  Stack A: auth-system
    └─ auth-backend
         └─ auth-frontend

  Stack B: user-profile
    └─ profile-api
         └─ profile-ui (imports from auth-frontend)

Dependency found:
  profile-ui → auth-frontend

Implications:
  ⚠ profile-ui cannot merge before auth-frontend
  ⚠ Changes to auth-frontend may break profile-ui
  ⚠ Consider coordinated review

Set up dependency tracking? [Y/n]
```

**Dependency Management:**
```bash
$ workstack stack link profile-ui auth-frontend

Creating cross-stack dependency...

✓ Linked profile-ui → auth-frontend
✓ Added dependency notes to PRs
✓ Set up CI dependency checks

When auth-frontend changes:
  - profile-ui CI will re-run
  - You'll be notified of potential impacts
  - Merge order will be enforced

View dependency graph: workstack stack deps --graph
```

**Impact Analysis:**
```bash
$ workstack stack impact auth-frontend

Analyzing impact of changes to auth-frontend...

Direct dependencies:
  - auth-tests (same stack)
  - profile-ui (Stack B)

Transitive dependencies:
  - profile-tests (via profile-ui)
  - admin-dashboard (imports profile-ui)

If you change auth-frontend:
  4 worktrees need attention
  3 PRs may need updates
  2 reviewers should be notified

Notify affected parties? [Y/n]
```

### Benefits
- Manages complex dependencies
- Prevents integration issues
- Coordinates multi-stack work
- Clear impact visibility

15. **Stack-Based Templates** - Standardization

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Patterns
- **Event System**: Many features benefit from a central event bus for stack changes
- **Cache Layer**: Graphite metadata should be cached and indexed for performance
- **Plugin Architecture**: Consider making advanced features pluggable
- **Background Workers**: Health monitoring and CI integration need async processing

### Integration Points
- **Graphite CLI**: Deeper integration with `gt` commands
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit/post-merge hooks for stack maintenance
- **GitHub/GitLab APIs**: PR management and CI status
- **Notification Services**: Slack, Discord, email for alerts

### Data Storage
- **Stack Metadata**: SQLite for analytics and history
- **Configuration**: Extended TOML format for stack templates
- **Cache**: Redis/in-memory for real-time features
- **Checkpoints**: Git bundles for state restoration

### Performance Considerations
- Stack operations should be parallelized where possible
- Large stacks (>5 branches) need optimization
- Visualization should handle 100+ branches
- Analytics should process months of data efficiently

---

## Conclusion

These features transform workstack from a worktree manager into a comprehensive stacked diff development platform. The key insight is that Graphite provides the stack structure, while workstack provides the workspace management - together they enable powerful workflows that neither tool could achieve alone.

The highest-value features focus on:
1. **Understanding** - Helping developers grasp stack relationships
2. **Automation** - Reducing manual coordination overhead
3. **Safety** - Preventing and resolving conflicts
4. **Education** - Lowering the barrier to stacked workflows

By implementing these features, workstack becomes the missing piece that makes stacked diff development accessible and productive for entire teams.
