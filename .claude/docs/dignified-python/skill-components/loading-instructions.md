## Loading Instructions

To load a reference file when a pattern is detected:

1. Use the Read tool to load the specific reference file
2. Apply the guidance from that reference to your code
3. Each reference is self-contained with complete guidance

Example: If you see `try:` in the code, immediately load `../../../dignified-python-shared/exception-handling.md` for complete LBYL guidance.

_Token-efficient skill: Loads only what you need, when you need it._
