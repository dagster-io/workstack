description: This skill should be used when editing Python code in the erk codebase. Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring Python to ensure adherence to LBYL exception handling patterns, modern type syntax (list[str], str | None), pathlib operations, ABC-based interfaces, absolute imports, and explicit error boundaries at CLI level. Also provides production-tested code smell patterns from Dagster Labs for API design, parameter complexity, and code organization. Essential for maintaining erk's dignified Python standards.
