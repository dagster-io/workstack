# Progress Tracking

- [ ] 1. **State detection approach**: User selected "Separate command" - Create distinct `erk-dev publish-release` command for the publish-only step. This changes the implementation from adding `--skip-prepare` flag to creating a new command.
- [ ] 2. **Validation timing**: User selected "Always validate" - Run all validation in prepare phase to fail early before any changes are made.
- [ ] 3. **Missing artifacts behavior**: User selected "Error and exit" - Exit with clear error message directing user to run `make prepare` first rather than falling through to full workflow.
- [ ] 1. **PREPARE phase** (lines 463-508 in command.py):
- [ ] 2. **PUBLISH phase** (lines 510-516 in command.py):
