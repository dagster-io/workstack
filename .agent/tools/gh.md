## What is GitHub CLI?

GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the official command-line tool for GitHub. It brings pull requests, issues, releases, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal.

### The Problem It Solves

Without `gh`, working with GitHub requires:

1. Switching to browser for PR operations
2. Manual URL construction
3. Context switching between terminal and web
4. No scriptable GitHub workflows

With `gh`, you can:

- Create, view, and merge PRs from terminal
- Manage issues without leaving your editor
- Script GitHub workflows
- Query GitHub API with built-in authentication

### Core Philosophy

**GitHub in your terminal.** `gh` mirrors GitHub's web interface structure but optimized for CLI workflows and automation.

### How Workstack Uses `gh`

Workstack integrates with GitHub CLI to enhance the worktree workflow:

#### 1. PR Information Retrieval

**File**: `src/workstack/github_ops.py`

```python
def get_prs(self, repo_root: Path) -> dict[str, PullRequestInfo] | None:
    """Fetch all PRs for repository using gh pr list."""
```

**What it does**:

- Runs `gh pr list --state all --json number,headRefName,url,state,isDraft,statusCheckRollup`
- Parses JSON output
- Returns dict mapping branch name â†’ PR info

**Used by**:

- `workstack list`: Shows PR status next to worktrees
- `workstack gc`: Identifies merged PRs for cleanup
