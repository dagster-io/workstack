"""Service for efficiently fetching plan list data via batched API calls.

Schema Version 2 Optimization:
- Extracts last_dispatched_run_id directly from issue body metadata
- Uses batch workflow run lookup by IDs (single GraphQL query for all plans)
- Eliminates expensive get_workflow_runs_by_titles() which fetched 100+ runs
- Eliminates comments fetch (worktree_name now in issue body)
