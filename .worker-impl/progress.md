# Progress Tracking

- [ ] 1. **Unit tests** for `create-impl-from-issue`:
- [ ] 2. **Integration test** for submit flow:
- [ ] 3. **Manual E2E test**:
- [ ] 1. **Git `allow_empty` support** - May need to add parameter to git integration
- [ ] 2. **Reruns** - Actually simpler: always reconstruct fresh from issue (no stale data)
- [ ] 3. **In-flight implementations** - Existing PRs with `.worker-impl/` will still work (workflow handles both cases until we remove the code)
