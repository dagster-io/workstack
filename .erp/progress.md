# Progress Tracking

- [ ] 1. `Ensure` is already imported in this file (line 10)
- [ ] 2. Current code is missing the red `click.style("Error: ", fg="red")` prefix - using `Ensure.invariant()` adds this automatically
- [ ] 3. Reduces boilerplate from 5 lines to 4 lines
- [ ] 4. Improves consistency with other error handling in the codebase
