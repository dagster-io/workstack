# GitHub Linked Issues Feature

## Overview

GitHub provides a built-in feature for automatically linking pull requests to issues and closing issues when PRs are merged. This feature uses special keywords in PR descriptions and commit messages.

**Documentation source**: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue

## Supported Keywords

GitHub recognizes **9 keywords** for automatic linking:

- `close`, `closes`, `closed`
- `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`
- `resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved`

**Case handling:**

- Keywords are case-insensitive: `Closes`, `CLOSES`, `closes` all work
- Optional colon syntax: `Closes: #10`, `CLOSES #10`, `CLOSES: #10`

## Where Keywords Work

### 1. Pull Request Description (Primary)

Keywords in the PR body/description are recognized when the PR is created:

```markdown
Closes #123

## Implementation Complete

This PR implements the auth refactor.
```

### 2. Commit Messages

Keywords also work in commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Fix auth bug

Fixes #456"
```

**Note**: PRs with keywords in commits won't show as "linked" in GitHub's UI, but issues will still close on merge.

## Automatic Closure Behavior

### Critical Constraint: Default Branch Only

**Issues only auto-close when PR merges to the repository's default branch (master/main).**

- ✅ PR targets `master` → Issues close automatically on merge
- ❌ PR targets `feature-branch` → Keywords ignored, no linking, no auto-close

This is a hard constraint - there's no way to enable auto-close for non-default branches.

## Syntax

### Same Repository

```markdown
Closes #123
```

### Different Repository

```markdown
Fixes octo-org/octo-repo#100
```

### Multiple Issues

**Must repeat keyword for each issue:**

```markdown
Resolves #10, resolves #123, resolves octo-org/octo-repo#100
```

**This does NOT work:**

```markdown
Closes #10, #123 ❌ Only #10 will be linked
```

## Limitations

1. **Manual linking limit**: Up to 10 issues per PR
2. **Cannot unlink keyword-based links**: Must edit PR description to remove keyword
3. **Default branch only**: No auto-close for PRs to other branches
4. **No label filtering**: GitHub closes ALL referenced issues (can't filter by label)

## API Access

### Via GitHub CLI

**Query linked issues:**

```bash
gh pr view 123 --json closingIssuesReferences
```

**Output format:**

```json
{
  "closingIssuesReferences": [
    {
      "number": 123,
      "title": "Fix authentication bug",
      "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Extract just issue numbers:**

```bash
gh pr view 123 --json closingIssuesReferences --jq '.closingIssuesReferences[].number'
```

### In GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Get linked issues
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
    PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  run: |
    ISSUES=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER \
      --json closingIssuesReferences \
      --jq '.closingIssuesReferences[].number')

    for issue in $ISSUES; do
      echo "Linked issue: #$issue"
    done
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Add Comments to Auto-Closed Issues

GitHub closes the issues, but you can add attribution comments:

```yaml
- name: Comment on closed issues
  run: |
    ISSUES=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json closingIssuesReferences --jq '.closingIssuesReferences[].number')

    for issue in $ISSUES; do
      gh issue comment $issue \
        --body "✅ Closed by PR #$PR_NUMBER"
    done
```

### 2. Filter by Label Before Acting

Check if linked issues have specific labels:

```yaml
- name: Process plans only
  run: |
    ISSUES=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json closingIssuesReferences --jq '.closingIssuesReferences[].number')

    for issue in $ISSUES; do
      if gh issue view $issue --json labels \
        | jq -e '.labels[] | select(.name == "erk-plan")' > /dev/null; then

        echo "Issue #$issue is a plan"
        # Take action for plans
      fi
    done
```

### 3. Prevent Closure of Specific Issues

**Note**: You cannot prevent GitHub's auto-close. Alternative:

1. **Document convention**: Don't use closing keywords for certain issue types
2. **Reopen issues**: Detect and reopen issues that shouldn't have closed
3. **Use non-closing references**: `See #123`, `Related to #456`

## Comparison with Custom Parsing

| Approach              | Parsing      | Robustness        | Standard         | Flexibility     |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| **Linked Issues API** | GitHub       | ✅ Battle-tested  | ✅ Universal     | ⚠️ Limited      |
| **Frontmatter**       | Custom YAML  | ⚠️ Must implement | ❌ Custom format | ✅ Full control |
| **Regex**             | Custom regex | ❌ Fragile        | ⚠️ Semi-standard | ⚠️ Medium       |

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Standard Keywords

Stick to the most common keywords:

- `Closes #123` - Most widely recognized
- `Fixes #456` - Common for bug fixes
- `Resolves #789` - Common for feature requests

### 2. Place Keywords at Start of PR Body

```markdown
Closes #123

## Summary

Rest of PR description...
```

This makes links immediately visible in PR view.

### 3. One Keyword Per Issue

```markdown
Closes #123, fixes #456, resolves #789
```

Explicit keywords for each issue ensures proper linking.

### 4. Document Conventions

If using labels to filter which issues should close, document this:

```markdown
# PR Guidelines

Use "Closes #123" for:

- Issues labeled `erk-plan`
- Issues you want auto-closed

Use "See #123" for reference without closure.
```

## Known Issues / Edge Cases

1. **Multiple PRs referencing same issue**: Last merged PR wins, no conflict
2. **PR to non-default branch then merged to default**: Keywords parsed on initial PR creation, not on merge
3. **Editing PR description after merge**: Does not affect already-closed issues
4. **Issue in different repo**: Requires full syntax `owner/repo#123`

## Integration with erk Workflows

### For `erk-plan` Issues

**User workflow:**

1. Create issue with `erk-plan` label
2. Create PR with `Closes #<issue-number>` in description
3. Merge PR to master → GitHub auto-closes issue
4. Workflow adds attribution comment (optional)

**Workflow automation:**

- Query `closingIssuesReferences` after PR merge
- Filter for issues with `erk-plan` label
- Add comments for traceability

### For `erk-queue` Issues

The `dispatch-erk-queue.yml` workflow already creates PRs programmatically - can easily inject `Closes #<issue-number>` into PR body.
