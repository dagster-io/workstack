name: dignified-python
description: This skill should be used when editing Python code for Python 3.10-3.12. Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring Python to ensure adherence to LBYL exception handling patterns, pathlib operations, ABC-based interfaces, absolute imports, and explicit error boundaries at CLI level. Essential for maintaining dignified Python standards.

# Dignified Python - Python 3.10-3.12 Coding Standards

> **See [UNIVERSAL.md](./UNIVERSAL.md) for standards that apply to ALL Python versions.**

This file contains Python 3.10-3.12 **specific** standards. For universal patterns (exception handling, path operations, CLI development, etc.), refer to UNIVERSAL.md.

---

## Python 3.10-3.12 SPECIFIC RULES

**Status**: This section will be populated with version-specific rules after research phase.

For now, all standards are documented in [UNIVERSAL.md](./UNIVERSAL.md).

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

For Python 3.10-3.12 projects, follow these rules:

1. **All standards**: See [UNIVERSAL.md](./UNIVERSAL.md)
2. **Version-specific rules**: Coming soon (deferred to later implementation)
