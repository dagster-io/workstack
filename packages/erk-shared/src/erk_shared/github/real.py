"""Stub GitHub implementation for dot-agent-kit context creation.

This module provides a minimal stub implementation of the GitHub interface
that can be imported by dot-agent-kit without requiring the full erk package.
The main erk package has a complete RealGitHub implementation with all the
actual logic.

This stub raises NotImplementedError for all methods since dot-agent-kit
never actually calls methods on the GitHub instance - it only uses GitHubIssues.
