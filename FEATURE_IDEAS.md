## 1. Status Command with Rich Information Display

### Overview

A comprehensive `workstack status` command that provides a dashboard-like view of the current worktree's state, replacing the need to run multiple git and workstack commands.

### Detailed Implementation

```bash
$ workstack status
```

Would display:

```
Worktree: feature-auth
Branch: feature/user-authentication
Location: ~/worktrees/myproject/feature-auth

Stack Position:
  main
  └─ feature/base-auth
     └─ feature/user-authentication ← (current)
        └─ feature/oauth-integration

Status:
  ✓ Working tree clean
  ↑ 3 commits ahead of origin
  ⏰ Last commit: 2 hours ago by John Doe

Pull Request:
  PR #234: Add user authentication system
  Status: 🚧 Draft
  Checks: ✅ Passing (5/5)
  Reviews: 1 approved, 1 requested
  URL: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/234

Environment:
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/feature_auth_db
  API_KEY=***hidden***
  DEBUG=true
  (3 variables loaded from .env)

Dependencies:
  Node: v18.17.0 (from .nvmrc)
  Python: 3.11.5 (from .python-version)
  Last install: 3 days ago
```

### Benefits

- Single command to understand complete worktree context
- Reduces cognitive load when switching between worktrees
- Quick PR status check without opening browser
- Immediate visibility of environment configuration

---

## 2. Batch Operations Support

### Overview

Enable operations on multiple worktrees simultaneously, saving time for repetitive tasks.

### Detailed Implementation

**Batch Creation:**

```bash
# Create multiple worktrees at once
$ workstack create --batch fix/bug-1,fix/bug-2,fix/bug-3

Creating worktrees:
  ✓ fix-bug-1 from main
  ✓ fix-bug-2 from main
  ✓ fix-bug-3 from main

Post-create scripts executed for all worktrees.
```

**Pattern-based Removal:**

```bash
# Remove all test worktrees
$ workstack rm --pattern "test-*"

Found 4 matching worktrees:
  - test-feature-1 [test/feature-1]
  - test-feature-2 [test/feature-2]
  - test-integration [test/integration]
  - test-performance [test/performance]

Remove 4 worktrees? [y/N]
```

**Batch Updates:**

```bash
# Pull latest changes in all worktrees
$ workstack pull --all

Updating worktrees:
  ✓ root: Already up to date
  ✓ feature-auth: Fast-forwarded 3 commits
  ✗ feature-ui: Conflicts detected
  ✓ bugfix-123: Already up to date

Summary: 3 successful, 1 failed
```

### Benefits

- Efficient management of multiple related worktrees
- Consistent setup across similar branches
- Time-saving for maintenance operations

---

## 3. Template System for Worktree Creation

### Overview

Pre-defined templates for common worktree types with automatic configuration.

### Detailed Implementation

**Template Definition** (`~/.workstack/templates/bugfix.toml`):

```toml
[template]
name = "bugfix"
description = "Template for bugfix worktrees"

[branch]
prefix = "fix/"
base = "main"

[env]
DEBUG = "true"
LOG_LEVEL = "debug"
ENABLE_PROFILING = "true"

[post_create]
commands = [
  "npm install",
  "npm run db:reset",
  "git commit --allow-empty -m 'chore: initialize bugfix branch'"
]
```

**Usage:**

```bash
$ workstack create --template bugfix memory-leak

Using template: bugfix
  ✓ Created worktree: fix-memory-leak
  ✓ Branch: fix/memory-leak from main
  ✓ Applied environment variables (3)
  ✓ Executed post-create commands

Ready to work on bugfix!
```

**Template Management:**

```bash
# List available templates
$ workstack template list
Available templates:
  - bugfix: Template for bugfix worktrees
  - feature: Standard feature development
  - experiment: Experimental branches (auto-cleanup after 7 days)
  - hotfix: Production hotfix template

# Create new template from current worktree
$ workstack template save --name "my-setup"
Saved current configuration as template: my-setup
```

### Benefits

- Standardized workflows across team
- Reduced setup time for common tasks
- Enforced best practices through templates

## Implementation Notes

### Common Patterns

- Most features benefit from the existing `WorkstackContext` dependency injection
- Many features can share code with existing `list`, `sync`, and `gc` commands
- Consider extracting common PR operations into reusable `pr_ops.py` module
- Analytics features could share a common time-tracking database

### Technical Considerations

- History/analytics require persistent storage (SQLite or JSON files)
- Notifications need background process or webhook server
- IDE integration requires understanding workspace file formats
- Templates extend existing preset system

### Future Architecture

Consider evolving toward a plugin system where features like notifications, IDE integration, and advanced analytics can be:

- Installed separately
- Enabled/disabled per profile
- Extended by third parties
