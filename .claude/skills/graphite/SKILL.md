# Graphite

## Overview

Graphite (gt) is a CLI tool for managing stacked pull requests - breaking large features into small, incremental changes built on top of each other. This skill provides the mental model, command reference, and workflow patterns needed to work effectively with gt.

## Core Mental Model

### Stacks are Linear Chains

A **stack** is a sequence of branches where each branch (except trunk) has exactly one parent:

```
VALID STACK (linear):
main → feature-a → feature-b → feature-c

INVALID (not a stack):
main → feature-a → feature-b
            └─────→ feature-x
```

### Key Concepts

- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Every branch tracked by gt (except trunk) has exactly one parent branch it builds upon
- **Auto-restacking**: When modifying a branch, gt automatically rebases all upstack branches to include changes
- **Directional Navigation**:
  - **Downstack/Down**: Toward trunk (toward the base) - `gt down` moves from feature-b → feature-a → main
  - **Upstack/Up**: Away from trunk (toward the tip) - `gt up` moves from feature-a → feature-b → feature-c
- **Trunk**: The main branch (usually `main` or `master`) that all stacks build upon

### Metadata Storage

All gt metadata is stored in the shared `.git` directory (accessible across worktrees):

- `.git/.graphite_repo_config` - Repository-level configuration (trunk branch)
- `.git/.graphite_cache_persist` - Branch relationships (parent-child graph)
- `.git/.graphite_pr_info` - Cached GitHub PR information

**Important**: Metadata is shared across all worktrees since it's in the common `.git` directory.

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Creating a New Stack

Build a feature in multiple reviewable chunks:

```bash
# 1. Start from trunk
gt checkout main
git pull

# 2. Create first branch
gt create phase-1 -m "Add API endpoints"
# ... make changes ...
git add .
gt modify -m "Add API endpoints"

# 3. Create second branch on top
gt create phase-2 -m "Update frontend"
# ... make changes ...
git add .
gt modify -m "Update frontend"

# 4. Submit entire stack
gt submit --stack

# Result: 2 PRs created
# PR #101: phase-1 (base: main)
# PR #102: phase-2 (base: phase-1)
```

### Pattern 2: Responding to Review Feedback

Update a branch in the middle of a stack:

```bash
# Navigate down to target branch
gt down  # Repeat as needed

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...
git add .

# Modify (auto-restacks upstack branches)
gt modify -m "Address review feedback"

# Resubmit stack
gt submit --stack
```

### Pattern 3: Adding to Existing Stack

Insert a new branch in the middle:

```bash
# Checkout the parent where you want to insert
gt checkout phase-1

# Create new branch with --insert
gt create phase-1.5 --insert -m "Add validation"

# Select which child to move onto new branch
# Interactive prompt appears

# Submit new PR
gt submit
```

### Pattern 4: Syncing After Merges

Clean up after PRs merge on GitHub:

```bash
# Run sync
gt sync

# Prompts to delete merged branches
# Confirms deletion
y

# Result:
# - Merged branches deleted locally
# - Remaining branches rebased onto trunk
# - PR bases updated on GitHub
```

### Pattern 5: Splitting Large Changes

Break up a large commit into reviewable pieces:

```bash
# Checkout branch with large commit
gt checkout large-feature

# Split into single-commit branches
gt split

# Rename branches meaningfully
gt rename add-api-endpoints
gt up
gt rename add-frontend
gt up
gt rename add-tests

# Submit
gt submit --stack
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't use `git rebase` directly**: Use `gt modify` or `gt restack` - gt needs to update metadata during rebasing

2. **Don't delete branches with `git branch -d`**: Use `gt delete` - metadata needs to be updated to re-parent children

3. **Don't assume `gt submit` only affects current branch**: It submits downstack too (all ancestors). Use `gt submit --stack` to include upstack

4. **Don't forget to `gt sync` after merges**: Stale branches accumulate and metadata gets outdated

## Integration with Workstack

When using gt with workstack:

- All worktrees share the same gt metadata (in `.git` directory)
- `workstack list --stacks` shows stack relationships
- `workstack tree` visualizes stacks
- `workstack sync` runs `gt sync`
- Metadata is auto-detected if gt CLI is installed

## Quick Decision Tree

**When to use gt commands:**

- **Start new work** → `gt create` (sets parent relationship)
- **Edit current branch** → `gt modify` (auto-restacks children)
- **Navigate stack** → `gt up/down/top/bottom` (move through chain)
- **View structure** → `gt log` (see visualization)
- **Submit PRs** → `gt submit --stack` (create/update all PRs)
- **After merges** → `gt sync` (clean up + rebase)
- **Reorganize** → `gt move` (change parent)
- **Combine work** → `gt fold` (merge into parent)
- **Split work** → `gt split` (break into branches)
